# CS3300_Project2

Second project for CS 3300, a course on Data Driven Web Applications at Cornell University. 

The goal of this project was to incorporate interesting data into a dynamic data visualization that could be interactive for the user as well as synthesize or digest variable data via navigation. 

This projects focus was more geared towards being fun and creative, so we took a dataset that is in-depth but also very interesting.  

Portions of the data viz has code borrowed from other libraries.
